## Problem Description

'''
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. 
The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Example:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
