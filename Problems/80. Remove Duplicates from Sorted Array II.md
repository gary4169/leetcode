https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

## Problem Description

```
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order,
remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. 
The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Example:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

```

## Code

```py
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        left,right = 0,0

        while(right < len(nums)):
            count = 1
            while(right + 1 < len(nums)and nums[right] == nums[right + 1]):
                right += 1
                count += 1
            for i in range(min(2,count)):
                nums[left] = nums[right]
                left += 1
            right += 1
        return left
